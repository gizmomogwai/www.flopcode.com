  Having projects besides a work and private life is not always easy. It shows that one cares about something, and that one is able to deliver something in short time.

  Coming from a strong java background most of my projects are based on java, some on ruby, which i like for scripting tasks. E-Lisp and DLang are more experimental for me, and I hope to at least look a little into other languages like haskell, scala, rust or objective-c.

  Have a look for yourself!
