%a.header Story
%div.chapter
  %p
    When switching from intellij to eclipse i missed a <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6274?pr=idea">plugin</a> which showed your source from a birds eye view. E.g. each letter represented as a pixel. I really liked this plugin, because you can estimate the complexitiy of a piece of code by looking at its &quot;graphical&quot; representation. Sure .. something like lines of code or how big one method is is also a good indicator, but i like this graphical approach.
%a.header Implementation

    Its been a while since i made the last change on this plugin. But i still remember, that it was kind of difficult to get to the textual representation of the editors (i think this is a good thing, because eclipse also allows you to make graphical editors and so on).
  %p
    Another thing was, I did not find a way to get all text-annotations of the system, so the preferences of the plugin only stored a set of annotations with optional colors. That also means, that you should adjust your settings to your colorscheme.
