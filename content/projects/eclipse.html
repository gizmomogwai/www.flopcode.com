  For me eclipse is a very good ide (perhaps as good as intellij). It has a very good plugin system (perhaps as good as the plugin system from intellij (which uses funky dependency injection and lots of cool magic with components)).

  Naturally one wants to implement some plugins to see how all those parts play together. With Eric Gamma in the development team it is sure that there is good testing support, which makes development for eclipse even more fun!
