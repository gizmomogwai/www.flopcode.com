%a.header Story
%div.chapter
  %p
    Everybody likes to work different. Here I describe how I work with
    dlang.
%a.header Installation
%div.chapter
  %p
    I rely on the <a href="https://dlang.org/install.html">install.sh</a>
    script. It works at least for dmd, ldc and gdc (the three main dlang
    compilers).
    Normally I go for dmd or ldc.
  %p
    As all my projects use dub basic setup is complete with that, on top
    are only convinient functions.

%a.header Shell
%div.chapter
  %p
    My fish shell is natively supported by install.sh so I can simply
    <code>source ~/dlang/dmd-2.*/activate.fish</code> of the version I
    would like to use.
  %p
    On top of that I also have a small dub wrapper called d, that not
    only makes it possible to call dub from any subfolder of a project,
    but it also selects the compiler version based on a
    <code>.dlang-version</code> file that is searched for till the root
    of the filesystem. Also it enforces out of sourcetree builds for runs
    and tests.

%a.header Editor support
%div.chapter
  %p
    The one stop shop is probably now VSCode + the Code-D plugin, but I
    like to use Emacs.
  %p
    projectile needs a new project definition to recognise dub projects.
    Mine looks like this:
    %pre
      %code.lang-javascript
        :preserve
          (projectile-register-project-type
            'dlang
            '("dub.sdl")
            :compile "~/bin/d build"
            :test "~/bin/d test && ~/bin/d lint --errorFormat=digitalmars"
            :run "~/bin/d run"
          )
  %p
    For a little tighter integration with emacs I use two flycheck
    checkers do build and test with coverage.
  %p
    <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a> is the new way to go,
    so I also use this with the builtin eglot (starting from emasc 29).

%a.header Code Quality
%div.chapter
  %p
    For code layout I use <code>d run dfmt -- -i .</code> without any special options. In the beginning e.g.
    the angel brackets on a new line was very strange for me, but now I just go with dfmt's defaults hoping for
    an uniform codebase also in other projects (actually I do not understand the need for customization in a
    tool like dfmt). In long method call chains I use <code>//dfmt off/on</code> to fallback to manually
    formatted sources.
  %p
    Dlang already supports at least line coverage in its default tooling, so if you run your tests with
    <code>d test --coverage</code> you get a bunch of nice <code>*.lst</code> files, that describe which lines
    have been executed how often. Into the dub unittest configuration I like to add a
    <code>postRunCommands "$DUB run lst2errormessages || true"</code> to get uncovered lines as warnings in the
    normal "compiler" output.
  %p
    <code>d lint</code> does the trick.
  %p
    To keep best practices for my dlang projects in place, I have a small helper called ponies, that helps me
    to groom my projects.
  %p
    Sooner or later licenses of dependencies are always getting interesting in real life projects. For that I
    use packageinfo in my dlang project to see, if there are some foul licenses involved (usually not in the
    dlang eco system).

%a.header CI
%div.chapter
  %p
    Most official dlang development and dub packages are done on github and usethe excellent gitlab workflows
    (<a href="https://github.com/dlang-community/setup-dlang">dlang-community/setup-dlang</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action">codecov/codecov-action</a>).
  %p
    I wanted to try gitlab ci for a very long time and recently switched to that. All my dub projects now build
    with their own docker image, which is created by a shared git repo pulled in as submodule (at the moment in
    version v1.0.2). I am quite happy with this, besides that it takes quite a while to build a docker image and
    then wait on the individual steps of the workflow. A local build for a small project takes only a few seconds.
    The same "done right" on gitlab can easily take 5 minutes!
